# EnDuRLM

This repo contains code used for paper **'Effectiveness of neural language models for word prediction of textual mammography reports'** from *University of Twente*, presented at [SMC2020](http://smc2020.org/).

Models used:
- [**LSTM**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.03314)
- [**AWD LSTM**](https://github.com/salesforce/awd-lstm-lm)
- [**FRAGE LSTM**](https://github.com/ChengyueGongR/Frequency-Agnostic)

Datasets used:
- [**MIMIC**](https://mimic.physionet.org/)
- [**ZGT Radiology Reports**](https://www.zgt.nl/)

Datasets were used under confidentiality agreements and therefore code doesn't contain any data.
